        "# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Tournament\n",
        "\n",
        "This project is a complete **Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) simulation** where different AI strategies compete against each other.  \n",
        "The main purpose of this program is to build and test an intelligent `player` function that can consistently win against a variety of opponent strategies.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Program Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Game Engine (`play` function)**  \n",
        "   - Simulates multiple rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players.  \n",
        "   - Keeps track of:\n",
        "     - Wins by Player 1\n",
        "     - Wins by Player 2\n",
        "     - Ties  \n",
        "   - Calculates Player 1’s win rate after all rounds.  \n",
        "   - Can print round-by-round results if `verbose=True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **AI Opponents**  \n",
        "   Several opponents with different playing strategies are defined:\n",
        "   - **Quincy**: Cycles through the sequence `[R, R, P, P, S]`.  \n",
        "   - **Mrugesh**: Looks at the last 10 moves of the opponent, finds the most frequent choice, and counters it.  \n",
        "   - **Kris**: Always plays the counter to the opponent’s most recent move.  \n",
        "   - **Abbey**: Tracks the last two opponent moves, builds frequency patterns, and predicts the next move.  \n",
        "   - **Random Player**: Picks moves randomly.  \n",
        "   - **Human**: Lets a user type in `R`, `P`, or `S` interactively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Custom Player (`player` function)**  \n",
        "   - The main intelligent bot in this project.  \n",
        "   - Uses **pattern recognition** to predict the opponent’s next move:  \n",
        "     - Stores opponent’s move history.  \n",
        "     - Looks back at the last `n=5` moves to detect repeating patterns.  \n",
        "     - Based on the most likely continuation of the pattern, chooses the counter move.  \n",
        "   - This approach allows the `player` to adapt over time and win against different strategies.  \n",
        "   - Performs best when looking back **3 to 6 moves**, with `n=5` giving strong results.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Helper Functions**\n",
        "   - `join`: Converts a list of moves into a string pattern for tracking.  \n",
        "   - `counter_move`: Dictionary to quickly find the counter move (R→P, P→S, S→R).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Unit Tests**\n",
        "   - Four test cases ensure that the `player` beats each predefined AI opponent at least **60% of the time** over 1000 rounds.  \n",
        "   - Opponents tested:\n",
        "     - Quincy\n",
        "     - Abbey\n",
        "     - Kris\n",
        "     - Mrugesh  \n",
        "   - Example test output:  \n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     Testing game against quincy...\n",
        "     Final results: {'p1': 652, 'p2': 280, 'tie': 68}\n",
        "     Player 1 win rate: 69.96%\n",

        "## Example Workflow\n",
